## Before putting in your head first 

Things to be considered before analyzing malware:
- Is it **packed**?
- What's the **communication tech./APIs**(Winsock2, Wininet, COM, WSK, etc.)?
- Does it **inject codes, or hook calls**?
- Any **anti-forensic, anti-debugging, anti-disassemble** techniques used?
- Is there any **API/DLL encoding**?
- Are **strings encrypted**? Which cryptography does it use?
- Does it use any **synchronization primitives**?
- Which **persistence methods** (registry, services, tasks, kernel drives, etc.) does it use?
- Does it inject **shellcodes** into an OS process?
- Does it install any filesystem **mini-filter driver**?
- Does it install any **kernel driver, callback, or timer**?
